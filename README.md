# N-Queens-Problem
The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. 

## Local Search Algorthims to solve N-Queens

* Hill Climbing
* Simulated Annealing
* Local Beam Search
* Genetic Algortihm

## Getting started

Heuristic function is used to measure the success of the placement of queens. 
Calculated as where two queens have intersection on their path. 
The path could be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

```
Similar to Queen in Chess
```

Our goal is to reach the global maximum. Which the heuristic is zero, means that no queens intersect.  
You can play with other algortihms , each have different parameters and approach to solve the problem. If you need further information about parameters  feel free to ask or serach through google :)
